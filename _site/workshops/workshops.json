This way, all the\r\nmaterials related to an analysis/project will be under one parent folder\r\nbut will be separated by content type (ex: data, scripts, outputs,\r\nreports, notes). All folders in this parent folder are easily accessed\r\nby the RProject.\r\nSome resources on project oriented workflows in R:\r\nWhat\r\nThey Forgot to Teach You About R: “Project-oriented workflow” chapter by\r\nJenny Bryan and Jim Hester\r\nR for data\r\nscience: “Workflow: projects” chapter by Hadley Wickham\r\n“Project-oriented\r\nworkflow” blog post by Jenny Bryan\r\nData\r\nFeel free to use your own data if you have data available.\r\nIf you need data to practice on, I suggest using data from\r\nthis\r\npaper. 1 The data contains information about\r\nthe seed yield, 100 seed weight, number of seeds/pod, number of\r\npods/plant and days to 75% flowering for 99 common bean variants grown\r\nin 3 locations. The data is listed under Appendix A.

I chose  Environmentally stable common bean genotypes for production in different agro-ecological zones of Tanzania  as it would give me a good understanding of common bean production and productivity in Tanzania.\r\nHere is the  slide deck  I made for the presentation.
