This blog will also be a resource to my colleagues who want to learn to use R for plant breeding. My current blog posts focus on phenotypic analysis for Common Bean.\r\nMy Background\r\nI graduated from La Salle University in Philadelphia in 2021 with a B.S. in Integrated Science Business & Technology (ISBT). Being an ISBT major taught me how to look at my skillset as a toolbox and use various tools from different fields to solve a problem. As I discovered more skills or tools to add to my toolbox, I found data visualization. I was immediately interested in learning how to visualize my work in a clear & concise manner. Slowly, I made my way into the broader field of data science and analytics. After graduation I became a data analyst intern at The International Center for Tropical Agriculture(CIAT) in Arusha. I primarily work on projects that deal with agrobiodiversity for the common bean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
