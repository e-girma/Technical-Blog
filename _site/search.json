In this role, I primarily work on projects that deal with agrobiodiversity for the common bean. I created this blog to have a central place to share what I have learned in this role. I also wanted to create a resource for my colleagues who want to learn how to use R for plant breeding.\r\n            I graduated from La Salle University in Philadelphia in 2021 with a B.S. in Integrated Science Business & Technology (ISBT). Being an ISBT major taught me to view my skillset as a toolbox and use various tools from different fields to solve a problem. As I discovered more skills to add to my toolbox, I found data visualization. I was immediately interested in learning how to visualize and share scientific work in a clear & concise manner. In exploring data viz, I made my way into the broader field of data science and analytics.\r\n            This is a site made with R Markdown, the distill R package, the postcards R package, and deployed to Netlify.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              About Ellena Girma\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Github\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Portfolio\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              I am a data analyst intern at The International Center for Tropical Agriculture(CIAT) in Arusha, Tanzania.

This page has some resources that can help you get R set up.\r\nDownloading R & RStudio\r\nIt is recommended that you use R on RStudio’s environment. So you will need to download both R and RStudio. A great video resource that takes you through the setup is Shashank Kalanithi’s Data Analyst Setup for Productivity (Python, R, SQL). Minutes 22:40 - 25:00 are what you’ll want to watch to set up your R environment.\r\nR Studio’s Interface\r\nR Studio has four windows that help organize your view as you work through your data analysis process. To get familiar with RStudio’s interface, I suggest watching RStudio for the Total Beginner. The tutorial focuses on how to navigate to and use each window.\r\nUsing R: Basics\r\nSince most of my blog posts will be about using R for plant breeding specifically, I wanted to share some external resources that you can use to get more familiar with R functions and uses.\r\nGeneral Resources\r\n RDocumentation  is a great site to search up R packages and functions.\r\n RStudio Cheatsheets  shares downloadable cheatsheets for many widely used packages that will help you figure out what functions in that package do.\r\nPackage Specific Resources\r\n ggplot2 .\r\ntidyverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
