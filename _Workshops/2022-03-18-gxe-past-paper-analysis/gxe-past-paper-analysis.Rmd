### Workshop 1

To learn more about GxE Interaction analysis, I picked a paper and did a summary presentation. I chose <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021000785"> Environmentally stable common bean genotypes for production in different agro-ecological zones of Tanzania </a> as it would give me a good understanding of common bean production and productivity in Tanzania. 

Here is the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LgVri_-f8JwH5cV9G_cj22qAGFSS0W0S/view?usp=sharing"> slide deck </a> I made for the presentation. I presented this to Dr. Teshale and fellow colleagues Leah, Ombeni, and Anne.
