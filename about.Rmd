I am a data analyst intern at The International Center for Tropical Agriculture(CIAT) in Arusha, Tanzania. In this role, I primarily work on projects that deal with agrobiodiversity for the common bean. I created this blog to have a central place to share what I have learned in this role. I also wanted to create a resource for my colleagues who want to learn how to use R for plant breeding. 

I graduated from La Salle University in Philadelphia in 2021 with a B.S. in Integrated Science Business & Technology (ISBT). Being an ISBT major taught me to view my skillset as a toolbox and use various tools from different fields to solve a problem. As I discovered more skills to add to my toolbox, I found data visualization. I was immediately interested in learning how to visualize and share scientific work in a clear & concise manner. In exploring data viz, I made my way into the broader field of data science and analytics.

This is a site made with R Markdown, the distill R package, the postcards R package, and deployed to Netlify.
